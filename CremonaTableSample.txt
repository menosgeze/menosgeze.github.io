This site is a front-end to the <tt>ecdata</tt> repository, hosted at
<a href="https://github.com/JohnCremona/ecdata">GitHub</a>, which
contains data files for (modular) elliptic curves over <b>Q</b>, in a
standard format to make them easily readable by other programs. For a
typeset version of the same data (with some extra data about local
reduction data) for conductors up to 1000, you can refer to the
book <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/book/amec.html">Algorithms
for modular elliptic curves </a>, CUP 1992, second revised edition
1997.  See the book's web site for more information, including errata
for the current (2nd) edition, and errata to the first edition (not
maintained since the appearance of the second edition). The errata
lists include errors and omissions in the tables. The files here have
the corrected data in them.  As of 2000 the book is out of print, and
CUP have no plans to reprint it.
</p>

<p>
For a more sophisticated web interface to this data and much more, use
the <a href="http://www.lmfdb.org">LMFDB</a>.
</p>

<p>
The files correspond to tables 1-5 in the book (Table 5 is not in the
First Edition), with additional tables:
<ul>
<li>Table 6 gives the isogeny matrices between curves in each isogeny
class;
<li>Table 7 lists the integral points on each curve;
<li>Table 8 gives information on which curve is optimal, and the Manin
  constant;
<li>Table 9 gives information on the mod-<i>p</i> Galois
  representations attached to each curve;
<li>Table 10 gives information on the 2-adic Galois
  representations attached to each curve.
<li>Table 11 gives information on the growth of torsion in number
fields of small degree, for each curve.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
From September 2005, a new labelling scheme was introduced for isogeny
classes.  The old scheme started
A,B,...,Z,AA,BB,...,ZZ,AAA,BBB,... and had become unwieldy.  The new
scheme is a straight base 26 encoding with a=0, b=1 etc., with the
classes numbered from 0 and leading a's deleted:
a,b,...,z,ba,bb,...bz,ca,cb,... .  The change to lower case is to make
codes such as bb unambiguous between the old and new systems.  For
conductors less than 1728 the number of isogeny classes is at most 25
and the only change is from upper to lower case.
</p>

<p>
We give all curves in each isogeny class.  For all classes of curves
of conductor less than 60000, and many others, the first one listed in
each class is proved to be the so-called "optimal" or "strong Weil"
curve attached to each newform (referred to as optimal curves from now
on).  For conductors above 60000, see the
section <a href="#optimality">"Optimality and the Manin constant"</a>
below.  Some of the data is common to all curves in the isogeny class.
</p>

<p>
The tables currently contain data for conductors up to <b>400000</b>.

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<ul>
<li>The curves were computed via modular symbols, using the C++
library eclib (see https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib), run on
  machines in a variety of places, including clusters at Nottingham
  (1999-2007) and Warwick (since 2011).  Additional data is computed
  using a SageMath script to interface a variety of software,
  including the following:
</li>
<li>
The modular degrees for conductors over 12000 were computed using Mark
Watkins's programs <tt>ec</tt> and <tt>sympow</tt>, via
<tt>SageMath</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Generators for many rank 1 curves were computed using either Magma's
<tt>HeegnerPoint</tt> function (written by Mark Watkins) or
GP's <tt>ellheegner</tt> function written by Christophe Delaunay and
Bill Allombert, based on the same ideas of Delaunay and Watkins.
</li>
<li>
The integral points for all curves were first computed using Sage in
an implementation due to Michael Mardaus, Tobias Nagel and JEC.  For
all curves we checked on 2018-12-19 whether these agree with Magma
(version V2.24-1): in 207 cases Magma found more integral points
(never fewer), and the larger lists which is hoped to be complete are here.
</li>
<li>
The images of the mod <i>p</i> Galois representations were computed by
Andrew Sutherland.
</li>
<li>
The images of the 2-adic Galois representations were computed using a
Magma program provided by Jeremy Rouse.
</li>
<li>
The torsion growth data was computed by Enrique Gonzalez-Jimenez.

<p>
Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer data for the optimal
curve in each class, exactly as in the book.  Column headings:
Conductor, class id letter, rank, real period w, L^(r)(1)/r!,
regulator R, rational factor, S. Here the rational factor is
L^(r)(1)/wRr!; when r=0 this is exact and given as a pair of integers
(numerator denominator); when r&gt;0 it is approximate, but easily
recognizable. Lastly, S is the value of the order of the
Tate-Shafarevich group as predicted by B-SD (the "analytic order of
Sha"), given the previous data and also the local factors and
torsion. When r=0 this is exact; when r&gt;0 it is approximate, and was
computed to several places but to save space is just entered as
1.0. (S&gt;1 in only 4 cases, where S=4 or 9).
